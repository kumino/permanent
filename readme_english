permanent

What is it?

permanent is a program for counting the permanent of a matrix using Ryser's formula with O(2^n*n^2) complexity. 
Not only numbers but also polynomials in many variables can be the elements of the matrix.

What do we mean by a polynomial?

By a polynomial we mean an arithmetical expression, which doesn't contain spaces written with the use of +,-,* and ^ signs 
with operators which are polynomials made of variables and brackets(the second term in operator ^ must be a positive integer
and the first term mustn't be an integer). By a variable we mean any sequence of symbols which doesn't contain arithmeic signs
but contains at least one symbol different from '0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9' and '.'. Any variable as well as any number 
is considered a polynomial. The multiplication sign can't be skipped: for example, 1.5x is an incorrect construction because the program
will take it as a single variable.
